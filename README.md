# AB-Testing

In this project, I conducted a market test for a coffee chain with a new menu. 
The project seeks to analyze whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. 
I ran an A/B test and wrote up a recommendation for a coffee chain as to whether the new product will be successful in the market.
